      title: "Deep Learning - Foundations and Concepts - Appendix A. Linear Algebra"
      url: https://www.bishopbook.com/
    objectives:
      - establish learning environment (active participation etc.)
      - reflect on personal goals, motivation and (prior) knowledge
      - make course goals explicit (and link them to personal goals)
      - anchor course topic within broader scope of machine learning and deep learning
    activities:
      - "general classroom setup: circle of chairs / round table"
      - "15min introductions: get to know each other (name, study background, semester etc.)"
      - "15min explain course rationale, (global) learning objectives, grading mode,
        establish/sign 'class contract' (signing can be done offline, bring to next class)"
      - "5min assign class documenter role for today
        (takes photos for short course blog entry and does 3min-recap in next lesson, rotates each time),
        if < 15 students, instructor takes this role for 1st class,
        documenters for remaining classes will be determined by doodle poll"
      - 5min explain learner blogs (example)
      - "20min collect expectations and prior experiences
        (option: ball joint with cross-disciplinary pairs: 3 steps, 5min each),
        5min for taking notes afterwards,
        homework: write this down in learner blog"
      - "15min group work: active structuring of ML topics (given topics, mixed groups)"
      - "15min topic map (together), can optionally moved to next class"
    note: "TODO: more links to online lectures/talks on basics"
