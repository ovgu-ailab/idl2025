# Reading Assignment: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Main Reading

The [Bishop Book](https://www.bishopbook.com/) only covers RNNs very briefly in Sections 12.2.5 and 12.2.6. Therefore, we have created an illustrated text for this course which you can access via the Moodle course (where you also upload your solutions to the exercises).

The figures and descriptions for the gated RNNs are based on the blog post on ["Understanding LSTM Networks" by Chris Olah](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). 


## Optional Reading

Recently, the [xLSTM (Extended Long Short-Term Memory)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517) has been proposed. Maybe, this is a paper worth reading...
