# Literature
---------------------------------

From 2025 on, we will work the "Bishop Book" [Deep Learning - Foundations and Concepts](https://www.bishopbook.com/) by Christopher M. Bishop and Hugh Bishop, published in 2024. 
You can [access the PDF version of the book for free though the university](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-45468-4).

Earlier iterations of this course focused on the [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville which is still worth reading - especially part II. In addition to the theory of various neural network architectures, it also has practical tips and pointers to a lot of the applied literature. But it does not cover recent developments of the last 10 years.

More literature will be listed for the individual lectures.
